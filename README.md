Environment for Modelling and Planning Robust Investments in Sector-integrated Energy systems (EMPRISE)

The modelling and optimization framework can analyze two-stage and multi-stage stochastic programming planning problems for robust energy system transformation pathways. The multi-period capacity expansion planning framework co-optimizes investment and system operation decisions for all relevant energy sectors.

To solve the complex optimization problems of large-scale planning instances in a decomposed and potentially parallel manner, the framework uses Pyomo/PySP's distributed algorithms.
